# Smart E-commerce Crawler - Auto-Crawling Instructions

When the user provides a collection/listing page URL and asks to crawl it:

## Steps to Execute:

1. **Navigate** to the collection page using browser_navigate
2. **Extract product URLs** from the browser snapshot (look for product detail page links)
3. **For each product** (limit to 10-20 unless user specifies more):
   - Navigate to product URL
   - Extract from snapshot:
     * title (from h1/heading)
     * price (look for $ pattern)
     * msrp (look for "was", "originally", "list price", "compare at")
     * brand (from page text or auto-detect)
     * sku (from URL pattern or page)
     * image_url (main product image src)
     * description (product description text)
     * collection (from breadcrumbs or URL path)
4. **Save to CSV** in Shopify format: `{site}_{category}.csv`

## Standard Fields (Always Include):
title, price, collection, description, msrp, brand, sku, image_url

## Extra Fields:
Auto-detect and include any product-specific fields (size, color, unit, etc.)

## Output Format:
Shopify-compatible CSV ready for import with shopify_wine_importer.py
